# finalprojectbattingaverage
This app will compute the batting average of inputted scores of cricket. There will be a home screen showcasing each object in the list, which will start with 0 objects. Then, when the user presses the 'New Score' option on the top, and an activity will pop up which will ask for the score (an integer), whether the batsman was 'out' or 'not out' - which will be indicated by selecting the box that states 'out' --> if the box is not ticked as out, then it is assumed that the score is not out, and by inputting an opposition - if the opposition is left blank, it will be considered an 'undefined opposition' when pressing other buttons. When you then press the back button on the top left of the activity of a new score, the user will go back to the homescreen and be able to see the list with each score inputted so far. On the top right, there is a 'show average' option, and the average is computed by adding the amount of runs scored and dividing by the number of outs - if a score was not out, then 0 would be the 'out' integer for that and if the score was out then 1 would be the 'out' integer, and by adding all of the integers together, we will get the number of outs. The average will be shown as a toast with commentary provided - if the average is between 0 and 20, it will showcase the average and also say "I'm guessing you're a bowler because you can't bat!" If it is between 20 and 40, it will show the average and say "I'm guessing you're an allrounder because you aren't good or bad." If it is 40+, then the toast will show the average and say "I'm guessing you're a batsman because you are pretty good at batting". If there are 0 number of outs (either through only not out scores or through no objects in the list), then the toast will not showcase any average (as it is dividing by 0) and will say "add a score in which you were out!" Additionally, there is a drop down menu on the top right, which gives three options: "show amount", "show oppositions", and "show average by opposition". Show Amount will show the amount of scores inputted on the top left in text. Show opposition and show average by opposition both display toasts. Show oppositions simply shows all the oppositions in a toast in alphabetical order, and show average by opposition shows the averages by opposition in a toast as well
